# FutureBlink assignment

## About
This task is a full-stack development challenge using the MERN stack. The goal is to build an email marketing sequence tool with a visual flowchart interface (using ReactFlow), allowing users to add nodes like Cold Email, Delay, and Lead Source, and schedule emails accordingly. The backend involves setting up APIs with Node.js, using Agenda to schedule tasks and Nodemailer to send emails.
